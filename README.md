# Heart Disease Classification
This repository contains a Python program for heart disease classification using a dataset. The graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to input medical data and get a prediction on the probability of a patient having heart disease.

## Here is an image of our interface.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and can be downloaded from the following link: [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset?select=heart.csv).

### Dataset Columns

- **age**: The patient's age in years.

- **sex**: The patient's sex (0 for female, 1 for male).

- **chest pain type**: The type of chest pain (values from 0 to 3).

- **resting blood pressure**: The resting blood pressure.

- **serum cholestoral**: The serum cholestoral in mg/dl.

- **fasting blood sugar**: The fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl).

- **resting electrocardiographic results**: The resting electrocardiographic results (values from 0 to 2).

- **maximum heart rate achieved**: The maximum heart rate achieved.

- **exercise induced angina**: Exercise induced angina (0 for no, 1 for yes).

- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

- **slope**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.

- **number of major vessels**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.

- **thal**: Thal type used in the perfusion test (0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect).
